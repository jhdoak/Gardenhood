### User stories that still need to be brought to life in v2.0:

 * As a USER, I want to see on a map where a user is located whose tools I want to borrow.
 * As a USER, I want to be able to choose between a view of just my tools and a view of the global list of tools.
 * As a USER, I can see contact information for a tool owner if they approve my request.
 * As a USER, I am alerting when I have pending requests to borrow my tools.
 * As a USER, I can communicate with other users who want to borrow my tools through a chat or messaging tool.
